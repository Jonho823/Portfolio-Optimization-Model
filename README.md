## Introduction

This project delves into the principles of portfolio optimization, drawing inspiration from the comprehensive content of the course presented by EDHEC Business School. By applying the techniques learned, I would like to showcase a nuanced understanding of portfolio management strategies and their practical applications in real-world investment scenarios.

## Data

This project utilizes two primary datasets, each with distinct characteristics and sources:

**1. 49 Industry Portfolios**

The dataset was obtained from the Kenneth French website and contains monthly returns spanning from July 1926 to February 2024. Kenneth French classifies each stock listed on the NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ into industry portfolios based on their four-digit SIC code, resulting in a total of 49 industries represented in the dataset.

**2. FTSE 100 Constituents**

This dataset encompasses daily stock data from all constituents of the FTSE 100 index, sourced from Yahoo Finance covering the period from January 2018 to February 2024. Data extraction was facilitated using the yFinance Python module.

## Installation Instruction
